title: Form Movement ++
originalAuthor: SapphireSapphic
game: kh2
description: Allows all drive forms to use Aerial Dodge &38; Glide, allows all forms except Valor to use Quick Run &38; Dodge Roll. 
Fully compatible with Zurph&39;s ValorMagic mods, as long as this mod has a higher priority. Also make sure this mod has higher priority than your rando seed, otherwise it probably won't work properly.
