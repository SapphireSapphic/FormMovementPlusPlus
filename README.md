# Form Movement ++ by SapphireSapphic

This mod gives:
 - Valor form Aerial Dodge 2 & Glide 2
 - Wisdom form Dodge Roll 2, Aerial Dodge 2, Glide 2 & 2x Draw
 - Limit form Quick Run 2, Aerial Dodge 2 & Glide 2
 - Master Form Quick Run 2, Dodge Roll 2, Glide 2 & Drive Converter
 - Final Form Quick Run 2, Dodge Roll 2 Aerial Dodge 2, & 2x Draw
 - Anti Form 2x Exp Boost (Removed No Experience), 2x Draw, Second Chance, Once More, 2x Jackpot, 2x Lucky Lucky

At some point I might try to update this to make it a more comprehensive and in-depth mod, but for now this is good enough for me.
Also, I gave each form Lvl 2 to make it so that you can't just breeze through CoR as soon as you get any form.
The draws on Wis & Final are mainly to make the data Demyx fight slightly less annoying.
The balance changes to Anti aim to make the form not completely terrible. At least this way it's good for grinding.
This mod should be compatible with most mods, including Zurph's Valor form Magic.
However, due to some constraints, this mod is NOT compatible with Anti form improvements (hence the improvements of my own).

Please make sure this mod is placed higher than your seed in OpenKH, otherwise it probably won't work properly.
