# Form Movement ++ by SapphireSapphic

This mod gives:
 - Valor form Aerial Dodge & Glide
 - Wisdom form Dodge Roll, Aerial Dodge, Glide & 2x Draw
 - Limit form Quick Run, Aerial Dodge & Glide
 - Master Form Quick Run, Dodge Roll, Glide & Drive Converter
 - Final Form Quick Run, Dodge Roll, Aerial Dodge, & 2x Draw
 - Anti Form 2x Exp Boost (Removed No Experience), 2x Draw, Second Chance, Once More, 2x Jackpot, 2x Lucky Lucky

The Level of the extra growth abilities will scale with the growth abilities on Base Sora.
The draws on Wis & Final are mainly to make the data Demyx fight slightly less annoying.
The balance changes to Anti aim to make the form not completely terrible. At least this way it's good for grinding.
This mod should be compatible with most mods, including Zurph's Valor form Magic. If using this mod with Valor form Magic make sure this has higher priority though.
However, due to some constraints, this mod is NOT compatible with Anti form improvements (hence the improvements of my own).

Please make sure this mod is placed higher than your seed in OpenKH, otherwise it may not work properly.
Also be sure that you have your Lua Backend configured to accept Lua scripts from OpenKH mods or it DEFINITELY will not work properly.
